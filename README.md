# Lorix (for browsers)

<img align="right" src=docs/images/lorix.png height="110px">

A browser version of Lorix, the _simple_, _user-friendly_ Javascript DataFrame API for transforming data.
For the original non-browser version, based on Node, see [here](https://github.com/jmsmistral/lorix)

### Features

- Enables rapid data wrangling on Javascript
- Exposes a simple, functional data-oriented API that operates over an array of objects
- Function chaining to encapsulate multiple data transformations in single blocks
- Helpful error messages to assist debugging

# Why Lorix?

I want a _simple_ way to wrangle data with Javascript for my own projects, instead of having to resort to pandas on Python.
Rather than building something low-level from scratch, optimizing for performance, I opted to design a DataFrame abstraction
over existing libraries like _lodash_ and _d3_. The idea isn't for this to compete performance-wise with other libraries
(far from it!), but to provide an _intuitive_ API for anyone to pick-up and transform small to medium-sized datasets directly in Javascript.
